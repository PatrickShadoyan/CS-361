# CS-361
This is a compilation of problems required as a final examination for CS 361 (Data Structures/Algorithms).
[![forthebadge](https://forthebadge.com/images/badges/made-with-c-plus-plus.svg)](https://forthebadge.com)

For the problems above, I applied knowledge of ADT's, Binary Trees, and BFS/DFS Graph Traversing algorithms.

As these problems were part of the final, code hasn't been optimized and some is unnecessary, but the core knowledge is shown.
